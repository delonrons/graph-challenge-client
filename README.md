## Graphql Front-End

### Setting up the workspace

To have the application running, I assume that you have ````node```` and ````yarn```` installed (I used v12.19.0), 
though I have used ```yarn``` ```npm``` should also work(not tested)

```
yarn install
```

### How to test the application
```
yarn test
```

Note: The unit test coverage is less

### How to run the application

```
yarn start 
```

### Areas of focus

The focus are of the development was the functionality, responsiveness and some minor animations. 

In this project, I have tried to use some cool libraries like Tailwindcss and Frame motion, 
even though I have not used these before. The logic behind using an unknown library, 
instead of developing styles and animation from scratch is that, the possibility of developing things 
from scratch is less compared to reusing the existing and that is often the challenge. 
By using the unknown libraries I have tried to showcase how quick I can adapt.
